 MINDED-FBA: An Automatic   Remote Sensing Tool for the Estimation of Flooded and Burned Areas

The MINDED-FBA is an automatic remote sensing tool for the estimation of both flooded or burned extents. The tool is freely distributed as a QGIS plugin, consisting of an adaptation and development of the Multi Index Image Differencing Method (MINDED) (Oliveira et al., 2019 and 2021). The MINDED-FBA tool allows integrating a diversity of satellite datasets, including multispectral, SAR or a combination of both - data fusion. Further description and demonstration of application of the tool may be found in the paper Oliveira, E.R.; Disperati, L.; Alves, F.L. MINDED-FBA: An Automatic Remote Sensing Tool for the Estimation of Flooded and Burned Areas. Remote Sens. 2023, 15.
